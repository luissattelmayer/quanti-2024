## Outlook on summer & next semester {.smaller}
:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- If you like R, I can only recommend you start to play around with it *on your own*
- Try to find quantitative papers in your field of interest
  - How do they measure things?
  - What data?
- What do you want to do?
  - Do you have the necessary skills or data for what you want to do?
:::

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- Making progress in coding takes time
- This brings me to my best advice, fix yourself a goal: what do you want to do?
- Lastly for frustration management: never work more than two hours on code when it is not working
  - Like seriously, take a walk and come back to it later! Try to avoid too much frustration with R ;) 
:::

## Personal experience 

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- I started out like you
  - and I struggled so much with my final paper
:::

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- The key is to start identifying the steps you need to take to achieve some bigger goal in coding
  - then start to learn or google the steps you need to take
- If I was not good at this three years ago, you all still have a chance; I mean it!
:::



## Some thoughts on a possible roadmap  {.smaller}

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- Here are some things you could check out on your own which I like and have worked on or am still working on: 
  - For some things on causal inference (in R): [Causal Inference Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/)
  - Ever heard of Bayes? [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) 
  - For some more advanced text-as-data stuff: [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)
  - One of the best R ressources out there: [Telling Stories with Data](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/)
  - Some text-as-data stuff but the theory behind it: @grimmer_text_2022
:::

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- Some shameless self promotion: Malo's and my class on Computational Social Sciences in January
:::

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- You don't have to get all fancy with webscraping, causal inference, TaDa etc. 
  - a great knowledge of statistics goes a long way and will save your time later on
- We are always in need of more quantitative PhD students in France
:::

## Final Homework  {.smaller}
- If you have questions on stats, text-as-data or any other coding related questions, contact me! I love talking about it and what I have shown you is only a marginal part of what you can do 
  - and once the semester is over I am much more flexible with my time
  
- The last homework for this semester: create a **meme** about this class, something you have learned or whatever you want; it can be about anything, get creative!
  - yes, it is mandatory, even it is a shitty meme

- Lastly, have fun during the final weeks while writing your code and your final paper ;) 

# Thank you for this semester with you; you were a wonderful class and I wish you all the best!
