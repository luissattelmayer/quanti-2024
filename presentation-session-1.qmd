## Presentation {.smaller}
:::{.nonincremental}
- PhD candidate here at SciencesPo at the CEE under the supervision of Jan Rovny
- BA at SciencesPo Nancy, MA in Comparative Politics at SciencesPo Paris
- My research focuses on mainstream parties, their decline and their issue engagement with the far-right's salient issues
- I work mainly quantitatively in R and Python, and employ methods that automate text analysis through NLP techniques and Machine Learning in general
:::

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- If you wish, this course is on a first name basis: 
  - Please call me Luis (he/him), "Dear Luis..." in emails is fine etc.
  - I will try to remember all your names and call you by your first names if you're fine with that
- I appreciate feedback! Let me know if something is wrong
- Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me if you are having any problems with this class!
:::


## Your turn!
- If you could put name tags in front of you for the first sessions, that would be great!

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
1. What's your name? 

2. Where are you from? 

3. What are your expectations for this class?

4. How comfortable are you with statistics and RStudio? 
:::

## Objectives
::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- Strengthening of your R skills
- Exposure to applied statistics in a more advanced setting
- Show you that R can be really fascinating (yes this is possible)

## Requirements {.smaller}
:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- You obviously need... R **&** RStudio installed on your computer
- Take notes
:::

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- Ask me questions as soon as you feel lost; do it!! 
- I am being serious
  - I will not judge
  - I will keep trying to give you new versions of the same answer
:::

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- Attendance is, as always, mandatory!
- And you're also required to have some fun :) 
:::


## Course Structure {.smaller}
- 6 sessions Ã  2h, each will cover a certain topic which Jan and Brenda will have presented

:::{.fragment .incremental}
- In these lab-sessions, you will learn how to apply your theoretical knowledge to 6 topics
  - A recap of RStudio (and the Workflow), OLS
  - Logistic Regression
  - Multinomial Regression
  - Instrumental Variables & DiD
  - RDD
  - Time Series
:::

## Course Structure {.smaller}

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- Each session will be divided into two parts
  - A recap of the theoretical concepts
  - A practical part where we will apply these concepts in RStudio
- I will try to have you code live but 6h is short... 
:::

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- Ask questions about things you have not understood in Brenda's and Jan's class! 
- I will cover theoretical things as well but this is supposed to be coding heavy
:::

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- I include optional sections in every session for those of you who already feel a bit more at ease with R
- I will also try to upload some scripts/extra material to my quarto book
  - webscraping
  - text-as-data
  - suggest things and I will see if I have the time
:::



## Course Validation {.smaller}
:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- One homework per session
- I will start to introduce different levels of difficulty (about three)
- You will have to choose one of these levels
- Work in groups of two
:::

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- You will have to submit your homeworks 1 week later at midnight every Thursday **on Moodle**
- Documentation in R works via RMarkdown or Quarto; we'll talk about it in a second (pdf or html format)
- You'll get feedback on all your homework
:::

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- Validation on a 0-5 point scale
  - it's not hard to get points
  - having (convincingly!) tried is the easiest way of getting points
- Not handing in anything is an issue
:::

## Office hours and help {.nonincremental}
- There are no office hours, sorry
- But my inbox is always open
  - I tend to either reply quickly or not at all
  - If no response > 48h, send the same email again; I promise I won't be offended
- Or just intercept me when you see me on campus

## Coding or Googling or ChatGPT? {.nonincremental}
- Last year I was still talking about Stackoverflow
- We all use ChatGPT
  - use it intelligently though
- There is some value in knowing how to hard code things
  - but there is also value in knowing how to find the right code
  - and in knowing how to adapt it to your needs



## Troubleshooting and communicating with me {.smaller .nonincremental}
- This might sound obvious but run lines one by one first
- Google error messages/ChatGPT
- Errors must be reproducible to be solved
  - I am here to help, it is my job
  - but I can only help if you provide me with enough information
- I need:
  - the error message
  - the code which produced it
